    <h1>Experiment on Reading Charts</h1>

    <p>
        In this experiment you will see a large number of charts, each representing 4 variables.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 4 variables of a chart represent a <b>system state</b>, which can be either <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b>.
    </p>

    <p class="strategies"></p>

    <h2>Chart examples</h2>

    <img class="example-image" /><br>
    <div class="example-image-captions">
        <span>State 1</span>
        <span>State 2</span>
        <span>State 3</span>
        <span>State 4</span>
    </div>

    <p><u>You should remember how each state looks.</u></p>

    <h2>Fast and accurate</h2>

    <p>
        It is important that you try to be as accurate as possible while completing the tasks without unnecessary delays.
        The pages are divided into training and performance checks.
        When training, you will receive immediate feedback on your answers.
        Do not waste time on analysing the results too much.
        During the performance check, you will receive no feedback on your answers.
